# Brain-Stock-prediction-using-openCV
 This project focuses on building a computer vision-based model to predict the possibility of a brain stroke using MRI images. Leveraging OpenCV and deep learning, this solution processes MRI scans to detect patterns or anomalies in brain tissue that may indicate a stroke. The goal is to automate early diagnosis.
